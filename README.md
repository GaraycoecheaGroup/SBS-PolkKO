**Tissue-specific mutagenesis from endogenous guanine damage is suppressed by Polk and DNA repair**<br>

## Abstract
Knowledge of mutational patterns has expanded significantly, but a persistent challenge is to link these complex patterns to the underlying molecular mechanism or source of DNA damage, especially when that damage is endogenous and not driven by environmental mutagens. Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a key determinant of mutagenesis, but what endogenous lesions require TLS and how TLS polymerases shape the mutational landscape of mammalian tissues is poorly understood. Here we characterize somatic mutational patterns across mouse tissues deficient in the TLS polymerase Polk. Our findings reveal that Polk plays a critical role in suppressing a new tissue-specific mutational signature in the liver and kidney. The signature is characterized by C>A/G/T mutations and shows a strong transcriptional-strand bias, which indicates that Polk performs error-free bypass of endogenous guanine adducts. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) functions alongside Polk mitigating some of this damage. Through targeted adductomics and biochemical analysis, we identify endogenous N2-dG lesions that necessitate Polk-mediated bypass and contribute to mutagenesis. Using untargeted DNA adductomics, we then reveal new endogenous guanine lesions that serve as substrates for NER. Together, our findings reveal the nature of endogenous DNA damage and the intimate link between the DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways that limit mutagenesis in tissues.
